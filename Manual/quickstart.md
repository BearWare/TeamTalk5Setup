# Quick Start

This section gives a brief introduction on how to set up TeamTalk and
connect to a server so you can chat with other TeamTalk users. The
first section explains how to configure TeamTalk and the second
section shows how to connect to a public TeamTalk server.

## Configuring TeamTalk ##

To start configuring TeamTalk simply press F4 which will bring up the
Preferences window. The first tab in Preferences is called General and
allows you to choose the nickname you want to use when talking to
other users.

If you're using speakers and not a head-set it is recommended to set
up a Push to Talk key-combination and disable Voice Activation. A Push
to Talk key-combination is a set of keys you need to hold down
whenever you're talking (the Control-key would be a good
choice). Using Push to Talk ensures there will not be echos from
speakers when people are talking. Below is shown the recommended
settings in the General-tab:
