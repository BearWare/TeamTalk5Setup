TeamTalk 5 for Debian 7/8
-----------------------

TeamTalk 5 runs on Debian 7/8 using ALSA sound system for audio and
Video4Linux2 (V4L2) for video capture.

When joining or creating a channel on a server then ensure that your
audio input and output devices support the sample rate used by the
channel, otherwise you'll get an audio device failure.


Dependencies
------------

In order to run TeamTalk the following dependencies must be
installed first:

- libqt4-core
- libqt4-network
- libqt4-xml
- libqt4-gui
- libasound2

To install the packages run the following command as 'root':

apt-get install libqt4-core libqt4-network libqt4-xml libqt4-gui libasound2


Run TeamTalk
------------

Use the run.sh script to start the TeamTalk client. The run.sh script
includes the shared library (libTeamTalk.so) dependency in the library
path.


Known Issues
------------

There are still a couple of issues which needs to be fixed in the
TeamTalk client before it runs smoothly on Linux. These are listed
here:

- Modifier keys alone cannot be used as hotkeys. Hotkeys needs to be
  either a regular key or a regular key and a modifier key. F12 seems
  like a good key to use as a PTT key on Linux when using KDE.

- Streaming video flickers sometimes
